## Project Vision:
An algorithm for finding a way out of a maze uploaded as an image. The shortest path is
then calculated on the server and the answer is returned as an image. Optionally, in a later
stage we want to include a browser-based maze build tool for painting the maze. The
shortest path should then be displayed directly in the build tool.
