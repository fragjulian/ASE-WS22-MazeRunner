<h1>About Maze Runner</h1>

<p class="info">
  An algorithm for finding a way out of a maze uploaded as an image. The shortest path is then calculated on the server
  and the answer is returned as an image. Optionally, in a later stage we want to include a browser-based maze build
  tool for painting the maze. The shortest path should then be displayed directly in the build tool.</p>
