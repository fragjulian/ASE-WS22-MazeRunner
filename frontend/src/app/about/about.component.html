    An algorithm for finding a way out of a maze uploaded as an image. The shortest path is then calculated on the
    server
    and the answer is returned as an image. Optionally, in a later stage we want to include a browser-based maze build
    tool for painting the maze. The shortest path should then be displayed directly in the build tool.</p>
